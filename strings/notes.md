Character set is the set of characters that are supported by a programming language like C/C++ or any other language.
We know well that computer system works

on binary number system, so everything in computer is numbers.
Then how they can support characters?
So basically they don't support characters. Then how we make them work on characters? So it means for every character we define some numeric value and for every character there are some codes defined and those codes are standard codes,every electronic machine follows that same set of codes. And those codes are called as "American Standard Code for Information Interchange",
that is ASCII code or ASCII codes.

These codes are given by American National Standards Institute, that is ANSI. And also it is ISO standard.
So that is the reason every electronic device supports these codes for English language. And moreover, for other national languages like Chinese, Japanese or Hindi, for various other national languages, the codes are defined and those are ISO standard codes and those codes are called as unicodes.

A-65         a=97        0=48
B-66         b=98        1=49
|              |          |
|              |          |
|              |          |
Z=90         z=122       9=57

for special characters also symbols are there : ( ) * ? + - ............
for enter = 10
for space = 13
for Esc = 27

ascii codes starts from 0-127 . Total 128 ascii codes are there.
